		 * OOPS concepts 
		 * 1. ENcapsulation 
		 * 2. Inheritance 
		 * 3. polymorphism
		 * 4. Abstraction

		/*
		 * 1. Inheritance:
		 * 
		 * acquired a properties from one class to another class parent class can access
		 * only their own methods father class can have own methods and also it can
		 * access parent class methods child class can have own methods and also it can
		 * access parent and father class methods code reusablity class can inherit its
		 * own methods and also it inherits parent class by using extends keyword
		 * 
		 * techinical term we are going to use is extends as keyword syntax :Childclass
		 * extends Fatherclass
		 * 
		 * Types of Inheritance:
		 * 
		 * 1. Single : Fatherclass extends Parentclass 2. Multilevel : Childclass
		 * extends Fatherclass 3. Multiple
		 * 
		 * parent class ,base class,super class child class,derived class,sub class
		 * 
		 * eg: vehicle method can use in both car and auto class
		 * 
		 * interview eg:
		 * 
		 * how selenium implemented inheritance that is called as Remotewebdriver
		 * 
		 * inheritance in selenium ==========
		 * 
		 * f3(open the declartion) f4(hierarchy)
		 * 
		 * ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver ChromiumDriver extends RemoteWebDriver
		 * safaridriver extends RemoteWebDriver
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 2.Polymorphism
		 * 
		 * many forms of same entity
		 * 
		 * 1.method overriding(dynamic binding and runtime polymorphism) when i override
		 * a method in child class that already used in parent class then it will be
		 * called as method over-riding priorty will be given to child class when we
		 * using same method in parent and child class findelement() eg in selenium:
		 * press f3 - (go to class) - ctrl+o
		 * 
		 * 2.method overloading
		 * 
		 * static binding/compile time polymorphism same method - different
		 * args/different number of args i can use same method name but have different
		 * args same method but different args in different order by using object in
		 * main we can access the methods of overriding sendkeys() in eg for
		 * selenium,substring in eg for java
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 3. abstraction
		 * 
		 * process of hiding the implementation details showing the only functionality
		 * to the user 100% of hiding can be done - interface partial hiding can be done
		 * design/blueprint
		 * clean coding pratice
		 * uniformity and stds
		 * 
		 * 
		 * - abstract
		 * 
		 * abstract class-class without a body /No implementation concrete class-class
		 * with a body/with implemetation
		 * 
		 * interface main plan /rule
		 * 
		 * new->interface
		 * 
		 * added unimplemented method using interface type the documentation using (**)
		 * use the keyword implements all the implemetation methods implementation class
		 * has its own methods
		 * 
		 * multiple level inheritance is not possible in class level but it is possible
		 * in interface level
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 4.Encapsulation
		 * 
		 * Data hiding
